summary: Prometheus for Kubernetes clusters
description: |
  Prometheus is an open source monitoring solution. Prometheus
  supports aggregating high dimensional data and exposes a powerful
  query language PromQL. This charm deploys and operates Prometheus on
  Kubernetes clusters. Prometheus can raise alerts through a relation
  with the Alertmanager charm. Alerting rules for Prometheus need to
  be provided through a relation with the application that requires
  alerting. Prometheus provides its own dashboard for data
  visualization but a richer visualization interface may be obtained
  through a relation with the Grafana charm.

    description: |
      Obtain a CA and a server certificate for Prometheus to use for TLS.
      The same CA cert is used for all in-cluster requests, e.g.:
      - (client) scraping targets for self-monitoring
      - (client) posting alerts to alertmanager server
      - (server) serving data to grafana

config:
  options:
    log_level:
      description: |
        Prometheus server log level (only log messages with the given severity
        or above). Must be one of: [debug, info, warn, error, fatal].
        If not set, the Prometheus default one (info) will be used.
      type: string
      default: info
    web_external_url:
      description: |
        DEPRECATED. This config option is no longer used, in favor of "skipPrefix".

        The URL under which Prometheus is externally reachable (for example,
        if Prometheus is served via a reverse proxy).
        Used for generating relative and absolute links back to
        Prometheus itself. If the URL has a path portion, it will be used to
        prefix all HTTP endpoints served by Prometheus.

        The URL provided must point to the root of the Prometheus web application,
        e.g.:

        http://foo.bar/

        Note, do *not* set this configuration to a specific to an API path, e.g.,

        http://foo.bar//api/v1/write  # DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME

        This configuration option takes precedence over the URL provided over
        the "ingress" relation.
      type: string
      default: ""
    metrics_retention_time:
      description: |
        How long to retain samples in the storage.
        Units Supported: y, w, d, h, m, s
      type: string
      default: 15d
    maximum_retention_size:
      description: |
        The maximum storage to retain, expressed as a percentage (0-100) of the PVC capacity (e.g.
        "80%").
        The percentage value is then converted to bytes and passed to prometheus with the
        `--storage.tsdb.retention.size` argument.
        Default is 80%.
      type: string
      default: "80%"
    metrics_wal_compression:
      description: |
        This flag enables compression of the write-ahead log (WAL).
        Depending on your data, you can expect the WAL size to be
        halved with little extra cpu load.
      type: boolean
      default: false
    evaluation_interval:
      description: |
        How frequently rules will be evaluated.
      type: string
      default: 1m
    cpu:
      description: |
        K8s cpu resource limit, e.g. "1" or "500m". Default is unset (no limit). This value is used
        for the "limits" portion of the resource requirements (the "requests" portion is
        automatically deduced from it).
        See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/
      type: string
    memory:
      description: |
        K8s memory resource limit, e.g. "1Gi". Default is unset (no limit). This value is used
        for the "limits" portion of the resource requirements (the "requests" portion is
        automatically deduced from it).

      type: string

actions:
  validate-configuration:
    description: |
      Run `promtool` inside the workload to validate the Prometheus configuration file, and
      return the resulting output. This can be used to troubleshoot a Prometheus instance
      which will not start, or misbehaves, due to a bad configuration.
