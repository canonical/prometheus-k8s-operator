description: |
  Prometheus is an open source monitoring solution. Prometheus
  supports aggregating high dimensional data and exposes a powerful
  query language PromQL. This charm deploys and operates Prometheus on
  Kubernetes clusters. Prometheus can raise alerts through a relation
  with the Alertmanager charm. Alerting rules for Prometheus need to
  be provided through a relation with the application that requires
  alerting. Prometheus provides its own dashboard for data
  visualization but a richer visualization interface may be obtained
  through a relation with the Grafana charm.
