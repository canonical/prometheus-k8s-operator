"""This charm library contains utilities to instrument your Charm with opentelemetry tracing data collection.

(yes! charm code, not workload code!)

This means that, if your charm is related to, for example, COS' Tempo charm, you will be able to inspect
in real time from the Grafana dashboard the execution flow of your charm.

# Quickstart
Fetch the following charm libs:

    charmcraft fetch-lib charms.tempo_coordinator_k8s.v0.tracing
    charmcraft fetch-lib charms.tempo_coordinator_k8s.v0.charm_tracing

Then edit your charm code to include:

```python
# import the necessary charm libs
from charms.tempo_coordinator_k8s.v0.tracing import TracingEndpointRequirer, charm_tracing_config
from charms.tempo_coordinator_k8s.v0.charm_tracing import charm_tracing

# decorate your charm class with charm_tracing:
@charm_tracing(
    # forward-declare the instance attributes that the instrumentor will look up to obtain the
    # tempo endpoint and server certificate
    tracing_endpoint="tracing_endpoint",
    server_cert="server_cert"
)
class MyCharm(CharmBase):
    _path_to_cert = "/path/to/cert.crt"
    # path to cert file **in the charm container**. Its presence will be used to determine whether
    # the charm is ready to use tls for encrypting charm traces. If your charm does not support tls,
    # you can ignore this and pass None to charm_tracing_config.
    # If you do support TLS, you'll need to make sure that the server cert is copied to this location
    # and kept up to date so the instrumentor can use it.

    def __init__(self, ...):
        ...
        self.tracing = TracingEndpointRequirer(self, ...)
        self.tracing_endpoint, self.server_cert = charm_tracing_config(self.tracing, self._path_to_cert)
```

# Detailed usage
To use this library, you need to do two things:
1) decorate your charm class with

`@trace_charm(tracing_endpoint="my_tracing_endpoint")`

2) add to your charm a "my_tracing_endpoint" (you can name this attribute whatever you like)
**property**, **method** or **instance attribute** that returns an otlp http/https endpoint url.
If you are using the ``charms.tempo_coordinator_k8s.v0.tracing.TracingEndpointRequirer`` as
``self.tracing = TracingEndpointRequirer(self)``, the implementation could be:

```
    @property
    def my_tracing_endpoint(self) -> Optional[str]:
        '''Tempo endpoint for charm tracing'''
        if self.tracing.is_ready():
            return self.tracing.get_endpoint("otlp_http")
        else:
            return None
```

At this point your charm will be automatically instrumented so that:
- charm execution starts a trace, containing
    - every event as a span (including custom events)
    - every charm method call (except dunders) as a span

We recommend that you scale up your tracing provider and relate it to an ingress so that your tracing requests
go through the ingress and get load balanced across all units. Otherwise, if the provider's leader goes down, your tracing goes down.


## TLS support
If your charm integrates with a TLS provider which is also trusted by the tracing provider (the Tempo charm),
you can configure ``charm_tracing`` to use TLS by passing a ``server_cert`` parameter to the decorator.

If your charm is not trusting the same CA as the Tempo endpoint it is sending traces to,
you'll need to implement a cert-transfer relation to obtain the CA certificate from the same
CA that Tempo is using.

For example:
```
from charms.tempo_coordinator_k8s.v0.charm_tracing import trace_charm
@trace_charm(
    tracing_endpoint="my_tracing_endpoint",
    server_cert="_server_cert"
)
class MyCharm(CharmBase):
    self._server_cert = "/path/to/server.crt"
    ...

    def on_tls_changed(self, e) -> Optional[str]:
        # update the server cert on the charm container for charm tracing
        Path(self._server_cert).write_text(self.get_server_cert())

    def on_tls_broken(self, e) -> Optional[str]:
        # remove the server cert so charm_tracing won't try to use tls anymore
        Path(self._server_cert).unlink()
```


## More fine-grained manual instrumentation
if you wish to add more spans to the trace, you can do so by getting a hold of the tracer like so:
```
import opentelemetry
...
def get_tracer(self) -> opentelemetry.trace.Tracer:
    return opentelemetry.trace.get_tracer(type(self).__name__)
```

By default, the tracer is named after the charm type. If you wish to override that, you can pass
a different ``service_name`` argument to ``trace_charm``.

See the official opentelemetry Python SDK documentation for usage:
https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


## Caching traces
The `trace_charm` machinery will buffer any traces collected during charm execution and store them
to a file on the charm container until a tracing backend becomes available. At that point, it will
flush them to the tracing receiver.

By default, the buffer is configured to start dropping old traces if any of these conditions apply:

- the storage size exceeds 10 MiB
- the number of buffered events exceeds 100

You can configure this by, for example:

```python
@trace_charm(
    tracing_endpoint="my_tracing_endpoint",
    server_cert="_server_cert",
    # only cache up to 42 events
    buffer_max_events=42,
    # only cache up to 42 MiB
    buffer_max_size_mib=42,  # minimum 10!
)
class MyCharm(CharmBase):
    ...
```

Note that setting `buffer_max_events` to 0 will effectively disable the buffer.

The path of the buffer file is by default in the charm's execution root, which for k8s charms means
that in case of pod churn, the cache will be lost. The recommended solution is to use an existing storage
(or add a new one) such as:

```yaml
storage:
  data:
    type: filesystem
    location: /charm-traces
```

and then configure the `@trace_charm` decorator to use it as path for storing the buffer:
```python
@trace_charm(
    tracing_endpoint="my_tracing_endpoint",
    server_cert="_server_cert",
    # store traces to a PVC so they're not lost on pod restart.
    buffer_path="/charm-traces/buffer.file",
)
class MyCharm(CharmBase):
    ...
```

## Upgrading from `tempo_k8s.v0`

If you are upgrading from `tempo_k8s.v0.charm_tracing` (note that since then, the charm library moved to
`tempo_coordinator_k8s.v0.charm_tracing`), you need to take the following steps (assuming you already
have the newest version of the library in your charm):
1) If you need the dependency for your tests, add the following dependency to your charm project
(or, if your project had a dependency on `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc` only because
of `charm_tracing` v0, you can replace it with):

`opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http>=1.21.0`.

2) Update the charm method referenced to from ``@trace`` and ``@trace_charm``,
to return from ``TracingEndpointRequirer.get_endpoint("otlp_http")`` instead of ``grpc_http``.
For example:

```
    from charms.tempo_k8s.v0.charm_tracing import trace_charm

    @trace_charm(
        tracing_endpoint="my_tracing_endpoint",
    )
    class MyCharm(CharmBase):

    ...

        @property
        def my_tracing_endpoint(self) -> Optional[str]:
            '''Tempo endpoint for charm tracing'''
            if self.tracing.is_ready():
                return self.tracing.otlp_grpc_endpoint() #  OLD API, DEPRECATED.
            else:
                return None
```

needs to be replaced with:

```
    from charms.tempo_coordinator_k8s.v0.charm_tracing import trace_charm

    @trace_charm(
        tracing_endpoint="my_tracing_endpoint",
    )
    class MyCharm(CharmBase):

    ...

        @property
        def my_tracing_endpoint(self) -> Optional[str]:
            '''Tempo endpoint for charm tracing'''
            if self.tracing.is_ready():
                return self.tracing.get_endpoint("otlp_http")  # NEW API, use this.
            else:
                return None
```

3) If you were passing a certificate (str) using `server_cert`, you need to change it to
provide an *absolute* path to the certificate file instead.
