"""# Alertmanager library.

This library is designed to be used by a charm consuming or providing the `alertmanager_dispatch`
relation interface.

This library is published as part of the
[Alertmanager charm](https://charmhub.io/alertmanager-k8s).

You can file bugs [here](https://github.com/canonical/alertmanager-operator/issues)!

A typical example of including this library might be:

```python
# ...
from charms.alertmanager_k8s.v0.alertmanager_dispatch import AlertmanagerConsumer

class SomeApplication(CharmBase):
  def __init__(self, *args):
    # ...
    self.alertmanager_consumer = AlertmanagerConsumer(self, relation_name="alertmanager")
    # ...
```

    charm's metadata.yaml file:

    ```yaml
    requires:
      alertmanager:
        interface: alertmanager_dispatch

    A typical example of importing this library might be

    In your charm's `__init__` method:

    ```python
    self.alertmanager_consumer = AlertmanagerConsumer(self, relation_name="alertmanager")

    Every change in the alertmanager cluster emits a :class:`ClusterChanged` event that the
    consumer charm can register and handle, for example:

    ```
    self.framework.observe(self.alertmanager_consumer.on.cluster_changed,
                           self._on_alertmanager_cluster_changed)

    The updated alertmanager cluster can then be obtained via the `get_cluster_info` method

    This consumer library expect the consumer charm to observe the `cluster_changed` event.

        #   static_configs entry.
