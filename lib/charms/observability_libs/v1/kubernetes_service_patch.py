"""# KubernetesServicePatch Library.

This library is designed to enable developers to more simply patch the Kubernetes Service created
by Juju during the deployment of a sidecar charm. When sidecar charms are deployed, Juju creates a
service named after the application in the namespace (named after the Juju model). This service by
default contains a "placeholder" port, which is 65536/TCP.

When modifying the default set of resources managed by Juju, one must consider the lifecycle of the
charm. In this case, any modifications to the default service (created during deployment), will be
overwritten during a charm upgrade.

When initialised, this library binds a handler to the parent charm's `install` and `upgrade_charm`
events which applies the patch to the cluster. This should ensure that the service ports are
correct throughout the charm's life.

The constructor simply takes a reference to the parent charm, and a list of
[`lightkube`](https://github.com/gtsystem/lightkube) ServicePorts that each define a port for the
service. For information regarding the `lightkube` `ServicePort` model, please visit the
`lightkube` [docs](https://gtsystem.github.io/lightkube-models/1.23/models/core_v1/#serviceport).

Optionally, a name of the service (in case service name needs to be patched as well), labels,
selectors, and annotations can be provided as keyword arguments.

## Getting Started

To get started using the library, you just need to fetch the library using `charmcraft`. **Note
that you also need to add `lightkube` and `lightkube-models` to your charm's `requirements.txt`.**

```shell
cd some-charm
charmcraft fetch-lib charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch
cat << EOF >> requirements.txt
lightkube
lightkube-models
EOF
```

Then, to initialise the library:

For `ClusterIP` services:

```python
# ...
from charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch import KubernetesServicePatch
from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort

class SomeCharm(CharmBase):
  def __init__(self, *args):
    # ...
    port = ServicePort(443, name=f"{self.app.name}")
    self.service_patcher = KubernetesServicePatch(self, [port])
    # ...
```

For `LoadBalancer`/`NodePort` services:

```python
# ...
from charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch import KubernetesServicePatch
from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort

class SomeCharm(CharmBase):
  def __init__(self, *args):
    # ...
    port = ServicePort(443, name=f"{self.app.name}", targetPort=443, nodePort=30666)
    self.service_patcher = KubernetesServicePatch(
        self, [port], "LoadBalancer"
    )
    # ...
```

Port protocols can also be specified. Valid protocols are `"TCP"`, `"UDP"`, and `"SCTP"`

```python
# ...
from charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch import KubernetesServicePatch
from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort

class SomeCharm(CharmBase):
  def __init__(self, *args):
    # ...
    tcp = ServicePort(443, name=f"{self.app.name}-tcp", protocol="TCP")
    udp = ServicePort(443, name=f"{self.app.name}-udp", protocol="UDP")
    sctp = ServicePort(443, name=f"{self.app.name}-sctp", protocol="SCTP")
    self.service_patcher = KubernetesServicePatch(self, [tcp, udp, sctp])
    # ...
```

Bound with custom events by providing `refresh_event` argument:
For example, you would like to have a configurable port in your charm and want to apply
service patch every time charm config is changed.

```python
from charms.observability_libs.v1.kubernetes_service_patch import KubernetesServicePatch
from lightkube.models.core_v1 import ServicePort

class SomeCharm(CharmBase):
  def __init__(self, *args):
    # ...
    port = ServicePort(int(self.config["charm-config-port"]), name=f"{self.app.name}")
    self.service_patcher = KubernetesServicePatch(
        self,
        [port],
        refresh_event=self.on.config_changed
    )
    # ...
```

Additionally, you may wish to use mocks in your charm's unit testing to ensure that the library
does not try to make any API calls, or open any files during testing that are unlikely to be
present, and could break your tests. The easiest way to do this is during your test `setUp`:

```python
# ...

@patch("charm.KubernetesServicePatch", lambda x, y: None)
def setUp(self, *unused):
    self.harness = Harness(SomeCharm)
    # ...
```
