"""# Prometheus remote-write library.

This library facilitates the integration of the prometheus_remote_write interface.

Charms that need to push data to a charm exposing the Prometheus remote_write API,
should use the `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer`. Charms that operate software that exposes
the Prometheus remote_write API, that is, they can receive metrics data over remote_write,
should use the `PrometheusRemoteWriteProducer`.

    """API that manages a required `prometheus_remote_write` relation.

    The `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` is intended to be used by charms that need to push data to
    other charms over the Prometheus remote_write API.

    The `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` object can be instantiated as follows in your charm:

    ```
    from charms.prometheus_k8s.v0.prometheus_remote_write import PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer

    def __init__(self, *args):
        ...
        self.remote_write_consumer = PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer(self)
        ...
    ```

    The `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` assumes that, in the `metadata.yaml` of your charm,
    you declare a required relation as follows:

    ```
    requires:
        receive-remote-write:  # Relation name
            interface: prometheus_remote_write  # Relation interface
    ```

    The charmed operator is expected to use the `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` as follows:

    ```
    def __init__(self, *args):
        ...
        self.remote_write_consumer = PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer(self)
        ...

        self.framework.observe(
            self.remote_write_consumer.on.endpoints_changed,
            self._handle_endpoints_changed,
        )
    ```
    The `endpoints_changed` event will fire in situations such as provider ip change (e.g.
    relation created, provider upgrade, provider pod churn) or provider config change (e.g.
    metadata settings).

    Then, inside the logic of `_handle_endpoints_changed`, the updated endpoint list is
    retrieved with with:

    ```
    self.remote_write_consumer.endpoints
    ```

    which returns a dictionary structured like the Prometheus configuration object (see
    https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write).

    Regarding the default relation name, `receive-remote-write`: if you choose to change it,
    you would need to explicitly provide it to the `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` via the
    `relation_name` constructor argument. (The relation interface, on the other hand, is
    fixed and, if you were to change it, your charm would not be able to relate with other
    charms using the correct relation interface. The library prevents you from doing that by
    raising an exception.)

    In any case, it is strongly discouraged to change the relation name: having consistent
    relation names across charms that do similar things is good practice and more
    straightforward for the users of your charm. The one exception to the rule above,
    is if your charm needs to both consume and provide a relation using the
    `prometheus_remote_write` interface, in which case changing the relation name to
    differentiate between "incoming" and "outgoing" remote write interactions is necessary.

    It is also possible to specify alert rules. By default, this library will search
    `<charm_parent_dir>/prometheus_alert_rules`, which in standard charm
    layouts resolves to `src/prometheus_alert_rules`. Each set of alert rules, grouped
    by the topology identifier, goes into a separate `*.rule` file.

    If the syntax of a rule is invalid, the `MetricsEndpointProvider` logs an error and
    does not load the particular rule.

    To avoid false positives and negatives in the evaluation of your alert rules,
    you must always add the `%%juju_topology%%` token as label filters in the
    PromQL expression, e.g.:

        alert: UnitUnavailable
        expr: up{%%juju_topology%%} < 1
        for: 0m
        labels:
            severity: critical
        annotations:
            summary: Unit {{ $labels.juju_model }}/{{ $labels.juju_unit }} unavailable
            description: >
            The unit {{ $labels.juju_model }} {{ $labels.juju_unit }} is unavailable

    The `%%juju_topology%%` token will be replaced with label filters ensuring that
    the only timeseries evaluated are those scraped from this charm, and no other.
    Failing to ensure that the `%%juju_topology%%` token is applied to each and every
    of the queries timeseries will lead to unpredictable alert rule evaluation
    if your charm is deployed multiple times and various of its instances are
    monitored by the same Prometheus.

        - application

        The value of the `groups` key is such that it may be used to generate
        a Prometheus alert rules file directly using `yaml.dump` but the
        `groups` key itself must be included as this is required by Prometheus,
        for example as in `yaml.dump({"groups": alerts["groups"]})`.

        The `PrometheusRemoteWriteProvider` accepts a list of rules and these
        rules are all placed into one group.

        Returns:
            a dictionary mapping the name of an alert rule group to the group.
