"""# Prometheus remote-write library.

This library facilitates the integration of the prometheus_remote_write interface.

Source code can be found on GitHub at:
 https://github.com/canonical/prometheus-k8s-operator/tree/main/lib/charms/prometheus_k8s

Charms that need to push data to a charm exposing the Prometheus remote_write API,
should use the `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer`. Charms that operate software that exposes
the Prometheus remote_write API, that is, they can receive metrics data over remote_write,
should use the `PrometheusRemoteWriteProducer`.

    """API that manages a required `prometheus_remote_write` relation.

     The `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` is intended to be used by charms that need to push data to
     other charms over the Prometheus remote_write API.

     The `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` object can be instantiated as follows in your charm:

     ```
     from charms.prometheus_k8s.v1.prometheus_remote_write import PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer

     def __init__(self, *args):
         ...
         self.remote_write_consumer = PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer(self)
         ...
     ```

     The `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` assumes that, in the `metadata.yaml` of your charm,
     you declare a required relation as follows:

     ```
     requires:
         send-remote-write:  # Relation name
             interface: prometheus_remote_write  # Relation interface
     ```

     The charmed operator is expected to use the `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` as follows:

     ```
     def __init__(self, *args):
         ...
         self.remote_write_consumer = PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer(self)
         ...

         self.framework.observe(
             self.remote_write_consumer.on.endpoints_changed,
             self._handle_endpoints_changed,
         )
     ```
     The `endpoints_changed` event will fire in situations such as provider ip change (e.g.
     relation created, provider upgrade, provider pod churn) or provider config change (e.g.
     metadata settings).

     Then, inside the logic of `_handle_endpoints_changed`, the updated endpoint list is
     retrieved with:

     ```
     self.remote_write_consumer.endpoints
     ```

     which returns a dictionary structured like the Prometheus configuration object (see
     https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write).

     Regarding the default relation name, `send-remote-write`: if you choose to change it,
     you would need to explicitly provide it to the `PrometheusRemoteWriteConsumer` via the
     `relation_name` constructor argument. (The relation interface, on the other hand, is
     fixed and, if you were to change it, your charm would not be able to relate with other
     charms using the correct relation interface. The library prevents you from doing that by
     raising an exception.)

     In any case, it is strongly discouraged to change the relation name: having consistent
     relation names across charms that do similar things is good practice and more
     straightforward for the users of your charm. The one exception to the rule above,
     is if your charm needs to both consume and provide a relation using the
     `prometheus_remote_write` interface, in which case changing the relation name to
     differentiate between "incoming" and "outgoing" remote write interactions is necessary.

     It is also possible to specify alert rules. By default, this library will search
     `<charm_parent_dir>/prometheus_alert_rules`, which in standard charm
     layouts resolves to `src/prometheus_alert_rules`. Each set of alert rules, grouped
     by the topology identifier, goes into a separate `*.rule` file.

     If the syntax of a rule is invalid, the `MetricsEndpointProvider` logs an error and
     does not load the particular rule.

     To avoid false positives and false negatives the library will inject label filters
     automatically in the PromQL expression. For example if the charm provides an
     alert rule with an `expr` like this one:

     ```yaml
     expr: up < 1
     ```

    it will be modified with label filters ensuring that
     the only timeseries evaluated are those scraped from this charm, and no other.


     ```yaml
     expr: up{juju_application="traefik",
              juju_charm="traefik-k8s",
              juju_model="cos",
              juju_model_uuid="b5ed878d-2671-42e8-873a-e8d58c0ec325"
           } < 1
     labels:
       juju_application: traefik
       juju_charm: traefik-k8s
       juju_model: cos
       juju_model_uuid: b5ed878d-2671-42e8-873a-e8d58c0ec325
