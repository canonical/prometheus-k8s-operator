        The :class:`PrometheusConsumer` object provides an interface
        to Prometheus. This interface supports providing additional
        scrape targets to the Prometheus monitoring service. For
        example suppose a charm's units exposes Prometheus metrics on
        port 8000. This charm may then have its metrics aggregated by
        a related Prometheus charm by instantiating a
        :class:`PrometheusConsumer` object and adding its units as
        scrape endpoints as follows

            self.prometheus = PrometheusConsumer(self, "monitoring", {"prometheus": ">=2.0"})

            name: a string name of the relation between `charm` and
                the Prometheus charmed service.
            consumes: a dictionary of acceptable monitoring service
                providers. The keys of the dictionary are string names
                of monitoring service providers. For prometheus, this
                is typically "prometheus". The values of the
                dictionary are corresponding minimal acceptable
                semantic version specfications for the monitoring
                service.
            multi: an optional (default False) flag to indicate if
                this object must support interaction with multiple
