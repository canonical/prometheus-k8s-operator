options:
  log_level:
    description: |
      Prometheus server log level (only log messages with the given severity
      or above). Must be one of: [debug, info, warn, error, fatal].
      If not set, the Prometheus default one (info) will be used.
    type: string
    default: info
  web_external_url:
    description: |
      The URL under which Prometheus is externally reachable (for example,
      if Prometheus is served via a reverse proxy).
      Used for generating relative and absolute links back to
      Prometheus itself. If the URL has a path portion, it will be used to
      prefix all HTTP endpoints served by Prometheus.

      The URL provided must point to the root of the Prometheus web application,
      e.g.:

      http://foo.bar/

      Note, do *not* set this configuration to a specific to an API path, e.g.,

      http://foo.bar//api/v1/write  # DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME

      This configuration option takes precedence over the URL provided over
      the "ingress" relation.
    type: string
    default: ""
  metrics_retention_time:
    description: |
      How long to retain samples in the storage.
      Units Supported: y, w, d, h, m, s
    type: string
    default: 15d
  maximum_retention_size:
    description: |
      The maximum storage to retain, expressed as a percentage (0-100) of the PVC capacity (e.g.
      "80%").
      The percentage value is then converted to bytes and passed to prometheus with the
      `--storage.tsdb.retention.size` argument.
      Default is 80%.
    type: string
    default: "80%"
  metrics_wal_compression:
    description: |
      This flag enables compression of the write-ahead log (WAL).
      Depending on your data, you can expect the WAL size to be
      halved with little extra cpu load.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  evaluation_interval:
    description: |
      How frequently rules will be evaluated.
    type: string
    default: 1m
  cpu:
    description: |
      K8s cpu resource limit, e.g. "1" or "500m". Default is unset (no limit).

    type: string
  memory:
    description: |
      K8s memory resource limit, e.g. "1Gi". Default is unset (no limit).
