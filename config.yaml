options:
  log_level:
    description: |
      Prometheus server log level (only log messages with the given severity
      or above). Must be one of: [debug, info, warn, error, fatal].
      If not set, the Prometheus default one (info) will be used.
    type: string
    default: info
  web_external_url:
    description: |
      The URL under which Prometheus is externally reachable (for example,
      if Prometheus is served via a reverse proxy).
      Used for generating relative and absolute links back to
      Prometheus itself. If the URL has a path portion, it will be used to
      prefix all HTTP endpoints served by Prometheus.

      The URL provided must point to the root of the Prometheus web application,
      e.g.:

      http://foo.bar/

      Note, do *not* set this configuration to a specific to an API path, e.g.,

      http://foo.bar//api/v1/write  # DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME

      This configuration option takes precedence over the URL provided over
      the "ingress" relation.
    type: string
    default: ""
  metrics_retention_time:
    description: |
      How long to retain samples in the storage.
      Units Supported: y, w, d, h, m, s
    type: string
    default: 15d
  maximum_retention_size:
    description: |
      The maximum storage to retain, expressed as a percentage (0-100) of the PVC capacity (e.g.
      "80%").
      The percentage value is then converted to bytes and passed to prometheus with the
      `--storage.tsdb.retention.size` argument.
      Default is 80%.
    type: string
    default: "80%"
  metrics_wal_compression:
    description: |
      This flag enables compression of the write-ahead log (WAL).
      Depending on your data, you can expect the WAL size to be
      halved with little extra cpu load.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  evaluation_interval:
    description: |
      How frequently rules will be evaluated.
    type: string
    default: 1m
  cpu:
    description: |
      K8s cpu resource limit, e.g. "1" or "500m". Default is unset (no limit). This value is used
      for the "limits" portion of the resource requirements (the "requests" portion is
      automatically deduced from it).
      See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/
    type: string
  memory:
    description: |
      K8s memory resource limit, e.g. "1Gi". Default is unset (no limit).. This value is used
      for the "limits" portion of the resource requirements (the "requests" portion is
      automatically deduced from it
